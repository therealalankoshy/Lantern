# The Lantern

Cost effective Standalone smart outdoor Lighting with Android support

## The Pitch

We are aware of the fact that our country. The problems that unfold with the increasing rise in power needs is multi dimensional. The magnitude of the crisis is humongous such that the effect it bears on the people is large.

Keeping this in mind we developed a solution to one of the common problems we saw. Saving electricity in an easier, simpler yet effective way. A smart device that falls under the bracket of automated device but a standalone one without needing to connect to internet/WiFi/Bluetooth. And we still provide a smartphone application to control the Lantern. And we got inspired from Googles audio AR technology.

We designed a device that senses the ambient light intensity intelligently and turns a bulb on and off. The advantage is that this device merges well with the existing surrounding of our households and no additional work is to be done. It's a plug and play device which blends in without modifying the existing electrical circuitry of the home so that no additional work is to be done by the consumer.

It includes the following features :

The user can choose if the light needs to run the whole night or he can choose to switch it off after running it for a particular amount of time.
The user can manually give in time at which it needs to turn on and that would be the reference with which the Lantern will work
It's build intelligently, the algorithm behind the Lantern makes it the smartest light which can identify any other source than sun affecting it. And simply choose to ignore it.
All this without the use of internet or Bluetooth. The app also lets you know exactly how much energy the Lantern connected bulb uses and lets you save money.

It doesn't depend just on the instantaneous light intensity like the products that are available in the market. Or a timer based switch works on basis of time obviously. But the sun won't set at 6:26pm everyday.

By intelligent sensing means that even if there are external factors which affects the light intensity suddenly, the Lantern detects that it's temporary and does not affect the Lantern. For example, it will not turn off if light from a bright headlight of a car passing by hit it or a street light shining on it.

Lantern works seamless without human intervention. Switch it on and forget it and start having a feel of automated lights and start saving money.

Lantern could be up in all the outdoor lights of all buildings and apartments and streetlights saving energy and providing ease of life and a step towards home automation to people who haven't yet tasted the feel for it by providing it at very competing price.
